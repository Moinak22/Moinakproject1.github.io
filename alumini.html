              <p>
                <span>Our alumni</span> are a valued part of our community. Their work after graduation helps us nurture our vision of a just, equitable,
                 humane and sustainable society. 
From the river islands of Majuli on the Brahmaputra river, to the urban neighbourhoods of Bengaluru, our alumni work in non governmental organisations,
 government and quasi government bodies, policy making institutes, corporate social responsibility (CSR), and small social sector organisations.
  Some of our alumni have gone on to start their own organisations, working with issues as diverse
   as running schools, providing employment to people with disabilities, to improving agricultural practices.
